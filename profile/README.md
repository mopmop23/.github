# Ruby Development


## Who we are:

We are a team of young developers and artists who love the popular voxel game Minecraft.
In particular, the PvP aspect of the game. Thats what this organization is about.


## What is your Client about?
Our client is primarily based on the popular Minecraft Multiplayer server, [JartexNetwork](https://jartexnetwork.com).
There are barely any Clients that provide a good experience for cracked users. And, above all, provide free items and loot!
Our client has free rewards you can win by doing various tasks, such as play for a certain amount of time.

## Who is on the team?

Our team currently consists of:

## Josh
Josh is one of the main developers, having thought of the idea together with Liam and Wiggels.
He's been playing Minecraft ever since it released, on all kinds of different devices, including Xbox 360 and Mobile.

## Liam

## Wiggels
