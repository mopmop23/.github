# Ruby Development


## Who we are:

We are a team of young developers and artists who love the popular voxel game Minecraft.
In particular, the PvP aspect of the game. Thats what this organization is about.


## What is your Client about?
Our client is primarily based on the popular Minecraft Multiplayer server, [JartexNetwork](https://jartexnetwork.com).
There are barely any Clients that provide a good experience for cracked users. And, above all, provide free items and loot!
Our client has free rewards you can win by doing various tasks, such as play for a certain amount of time.

## Who is on the team?

Our team currently consists of:

## Josh
Hello, my name is Josh. My primary job within this organization is to develop and release new updates of the Minecraft client. I am part of the upper Management Team, working directly with Liam and Wiggels to provide the best experience for our users, and giving my vote on important events and updates we wish to implement. I've been developing for around 4 years now, beginning with Discord Bots written in Python, to making Spigot Plugins in Java, which I still actively do, and since 2022, developing Minecraft Clients in Java. I've had roughly 11 years of experience with Minecraft, which is quite a lot, given the fact it is 3 quarters of my life. My plans for the future are to learn C#, JavaScript and Rust.

## Liam
